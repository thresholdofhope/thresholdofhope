    Managing your anger sounds like an easy task but it is not very simple to do it. Getting angry easily, shouting at people, and then regretting later are some of the situations which we wish were in our control.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being angry is normal. Taking out your frustration is also okay. Then what is the problem?
    </p>
    <p>
        The problem starts when your anger starts affecting your relationships and health. Yes, in many cases it is seen that people who get angry easily do not have good relationships. They are short-tempered and often take out their anger on people around them.
    </p>
    <p>
        People dealing with anger issues also suffer from high blood pressure and stress. Hence it becomes important to focus on it and take proper help.

           How to Control Anger?

    </p>
    <p>In the moment, anger can be difficult to stop in its tracks. However, detecting the emotion early can be key. It can allow a person to redirect their thought process to a more constructive place.</p>
    <p>Anger causes a physical reaction in the body. It releases adrenaline, the “fight-or-flight” hormone that prepares a person for conflict or danger.</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="coach">a rapid heartbeat</li>
        <li class="coach">faster breathing</li>
        <li class="coach">tension throughout the body</li>
        <li class="coach">restlessness, pacing, and tapping of the feet</li>
        <li class="coach">clenched fists and jaw</li>
        <li class="coach">sweating and trembling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These physical effects can signal a proportionate response to a situation.</p>
    <p>Regardless, recognizing the signals early can help a person assess whether the trigger warrants this physical response.</p>

    </p>
    <h3  class="spy">Taking a step back</h3>
    <p>Buying some time can be fundamental in limiting an angry response. This can involve simple measures.</p>
    <p>When confronted with a trigger, it may help to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="coach">count to 10</li>
        <li class="coach">go for a short walk</li>
        <li class="coach">go for a short walk</li>
        <li class="coach">make contact with a person who is not immediately involved, such as a friend, family member, or counselor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It can help to vocally express the thoughts behind the anger to a person who is not the focus of the reaction.</p>
    <p>This can help defuse the situation and more clearly identify the cause of the intense feelings.</p>

    </p>
    <h3  class="spy">Applying management techniques</h3>
    <p>These can help calm a person or distract them long enough to process the thoughts in a constructive way.</p>
    <p>Different techniques are effective for different people, but finding a method that works can be instrumental in defusing episodes of extreme anger.</p>
    <p>
        <h3 class="spy"> <strong>Some Techniques also include: </strong>
        </h3>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="coach">Deep, slow breathing: Focus on each breath as it moves in and out, and try to spend more time exhaling than inhaling.</li>
        <li class="coach">Easing physical tension: Try tensing each part of the body for a count of 10, then releasing it.</li>
        <li class="coach">Mindfulness: Meditation is one example of a mindfulness technique, and these can help shift the mind away from anger during triggering situations, especially after consistent practice.</li>
        <li class="coach">Exercise: Physical activity is a great way to use up excess adrenalin. A brisk run or walk or combat sports, such as boxing or martial arts, can be useful outlets for aggressive or confrontational feelings.</li>
        <li class="coach">Find alternative channels for anger: It can help to express anger in a way that limits harm to others, such as tearing newspaper, crushing ice cubes over a sink, or punching or screaming into a pillow.</li>
        <li class="coach">Create distractions: Distraction techniques, such as dancing to energetic music, taking a relaxing shower, or building, fixing, writing, or drawing, can provide distance from the issue.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When preparing to bring up frustration with a peer, it can help to plan what to say. This can help maintain focus and direction in the conversation and reduce the risk of misguided anger.</p>
    <p>Also, focusing on solutions rather than problems increases the chances of a resolution and reduces the likelihood of an angry reaction.</p>
    <p>Getting at least 7 hours of quality sleep every night also contributes to mental and physical health. Researchers have linked <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/307334.php" target="_blank"  title="What to know about sleep deprivation" class="content-link css-29oowu keywords">sleep deprivation</a> to a number of health problems, including irritability and anger.</p>
