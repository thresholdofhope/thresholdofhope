        <h1>DEPRESSION COUNSELLING </h1>
    </div>
    <div class=" para">
        <p>Depression Counselling is one of the many effective tools of the modern world that helps in fighting the most
            common form of mental illness known as depression. This form of therapy helps individuals to reflect on
            their emotional state and yet be efficient in their day to day life. Online Counselling has come as a
            lifesaver as you can consult a psychologist online from the comforts of your home.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="head">
        <p><strong>How did it gain importance?</strong></p>

    </div>
    <div class=" para">
        <p>It started when it was clearly established that depression affects millions of people across the world. It
            makes everything difficult, even getting out of bed may seem like a difficult task. It makes your body and
            mind sluggish, resulting in lowered productivity and inefficiency.</p>
    
    
        <p>Later experts recognized the dangerous psychological and physiological effects on people who suffered from
            depression. You may not be surprised to know that common physical illnesses like heart attack, unusual heart
            rhythm, cardiovascular diseases, increased or unstable blood pressure, and insomnia/oversleeping may stem
            from depression.</p>

    
    
        <p>Others may experience lack of hunger/overeating, some may gain or lose enormous amounts of weight in a short
            duration of time etc. Psychologically, it can push an individual towards overthinking, negative thinking and
            social anxiety. It could lead to poor concentration power and even reduced ability to make decisions in
            daily life. Some individuals may experience low mood, hopelessness, loss of interest in pleasure and social
            events and much more.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="head">
        <p><strong>What do you do if you think you are in depression?</strong></p>
    </div>
    <div class=" para">
        <p>It has become the most common mental illness in the world because of its ability to stem from almost any
            aspect of life. So if you see someone showing any of the signs hinting towards depression, recommend them
            online counselling or you could motivate them to consult a doctor or a psychologist.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="head"><strong><p>Or, what do you do when you see a friend in depression?</p>

    </strong></div>
<div class="para"><p>The unfortunate reality is that many people don’t even realise that they suffer from or are suffering from depression their whole life. And this affects their work, personal and social life, turning everything against them. There are many reasons that can cause depression; however, it depends on individual life situations and daily choices. Some common reasons for the cause are unemployment, financial crisis, and unhealthy relationships with spouses, parents and even children. Some may get depressed due to sudden loss of a loved one or a major life changing episode like separation or divorce. In some cases, experts also see chronic stress as one of the major contributors that cause depression.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended to consult a psychologist or ask a doctor for the correct diagnosis and treatment plan.

<div class="head"><strong><p>Self Help Techniques</p></strong></div>
<div class="para"><p>However, there are other ways that could help people get rid of depression with no external help. These self help techniques have proven to be effective and have helped people with mental illnesses, resulting in improved health conditions. They include deep breathing and meditation practices, regular exercising, writing your thoughts in a thought challenge diary, which helps you reflect on how you feel. Some research suggests eating plant based foods like leafy vegetables and fruits as they are high in nutritional content like essential vitamins and minerals that can help in lifting the mood.

</div>

<div class="head"><strong><p>How does meditation help in battling depression?

</p></strong></div>

<div class="para"><p>Depression can involve a lot of dark thoughts. You might feel hopeless, worthless, or angry at life (or even yourself). This can make meditation seem somewhat counterintuitive, since it involves increasing awareness around thoughts and experiences.

    But meditation teaches you to pay attention to thoughts and feelings without passing judgment or criticizing yourself.</p>

    <p>Meditation doesn’t involve pushing away these thoughts or pretending you don’t have them. Instead, you notice and accept them, then let them go. In this way, meditation can help disrupt cycles of negative thinking.Meditation can make it easier to pay attention to your emotions as they come up. So, when you begin experiencing negative thought patterns or notice increased irritability, fatigue, or less interest in the things you usually like to do, you might choose to focus on self-care to keep things from getting worse.</p></div>

                    <div class="para"><p>Most of us experience times when we need help dealing with problems or issues that cause emotional distress. If you are having a problem that is making you feel overwhelmed and/or interfering with normal daily life, you may benefit from the assistance of an experienced, trained professional.

                        While some people have been taught that seeking mental health (also called “behavioral health,” “psychotherapy,” and “counseling”) services is a sign of weakness, it can actually be a sign of strength in that you are using your resources.</p>
                    <p>All of these clinicians have advanced training and have passed licensing exams. They primarily use various types of talk therapy and/or medications to treat mental health issues. For children, some clinicians use play therapy. Many MHPs have specific areas of interest, experience, and expertise. It may be helpful to speak with that clinician or his/her representative to determine if he/she is a good fit for your needs. When it is in the best interest of the patient, MHP’s will collaborate with and refer to other health professionals.</p></div>
