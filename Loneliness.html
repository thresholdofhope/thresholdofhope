        WAYS TO MANAGE LONELINESS PROBLEM
    </h1>
    <div class="first">
        <h2>
            Definition and Causes of Loneliness
        </h2>
        <br>
        <div>
            <p>While common definitions of loneliness describe it as a state of solitude or being alone, loneliness
                is
                actually a state of mind. Loneliness is defined by researchers as feeling lonely more than once a
                week.
                Loneliness causes people to feel empty, alone, and unwanted. People who are lonely often crave human
                contact, but their state of mind makes it more difficult to form connections with other people.
                Loneliness, according to many experts, is not necessarily about being alone. Instead, if you feel
                alone
                and isolated, then that is how loneliness plays into your state of mind.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Contributing factors to loneliness include situational variables, such as physical isolation, moving to
            a
            new location, and divorce.The death of someone significant in a person's life can also lead to feelings
            of
            loneliness. Additionally, it can be a symptom of a psychological disorder such as depression.
            Loneliness can also be attributed to internal factors such as low self-esteem. People who lack
            confidence in
            themselves often believe that they are unworthy of the attention or regard of other people, which can
            lead
            to isolation and chronic loneliness.

    </div>
    <div class="second">
        <h2>Loneliness can happen for a number of reasons. For example, you might feel lonely if </h2> <br>
        <div>
            <p>
                <li> change in schools or jobs</li>
                <li> work from home</li>
                <li> moving to a new city</li>
                <li> end of a relationship</li>
                <li> If you are living alone for the first time</li>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>
                As you adjust to these new circumstances, feelings of loneliness may pass, but sometimes they
                persist.
                It’s not always easy to talk about feeling lonely, and if you have a hard time reaching out to
                others,
                you might feel even more alone.

                A lack of meaningful connections also contributes to loneliness, which is why you can feel lonely
                even
                if you have a wide social network.

                Maybe you have a lot of casual friends and fill your time with social activities but don’t feel too
                close to anyone. Spending a lot of time with couples and families can also lead to feelings of
                loneliness if you’re single and don’t want to be. This could happen even when you’re happily single.
                <br>
                <br>
                Living with mental or physical health issues can also increase risk for loneliness. Health concerns
                can
                be isolating, since it can be difficult to explain how you feel. Sometimes social activities demand
                too
                much emotional or physical energy, and you might end up canceling more plans than you keep.

                Eventually, a continued lack of social connection might make you feel even worse.Loneliness can also
                be
                attributed to internal factors such as low self-esteem. People who lack confidence in themselves
                often
                believe that they are unworthy of the attention or regard of other people, which can lead to
                isolation
                and chronic loneliness.

            Tips to Prevent and Overcome Loneliness
        </h2>
        <br>
        <div>
            <p>
                Loneliness can be overcome. It does require a conscious effort on your part to make a change. In
                the
                long run, making a change can make you happier, healthier, and enable you to impact others
                around
                you in
                a positive way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some ways to prevent loneliness: <br>
                <li> Consider community service or another activity that you enjoy. These situations present great
                    opportunities to meet people and cultivate new friendships and social interactions.</li>

                <br>
                <li> Expect the best. Lonely people often expect rejection, so instead focus on positive thoughts
                    and
                    attitudes in your social relationships.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Volunteer or participate in community events. Find a few areas you’re interested in and try
                    to get
                    involved. Consider helping at library book sales, donating a weekend a month to your local
                    animal
                    shelter, helping out with trash cleanup, or spending a few hours working at your local food
                    bank.
                    Libraries are also a good place to find out about community events.</li><br>
            <div class="picture"><img
                    src="https://blogmedia.evbstatic.com/wp-content/uploads/wpmulti/sites/3/2019/03/xxu.jpg" alt="pic">
            </div><br>
            <li> Recognize that loneliness is a sign that something needs to change.</li><br>
            <li>Understand the effects of loneliness on your life. There are physical and mental
                repercussions for
                loneliness.</li>
            <br>

            <li>Try a new hobby. If you feel lonely but have a good amount of free time, think about things
                you’ve
                always wanted to try. Dance? Woodworking? Art? Guitar? Your library, a local community college,
                or
                other
                community organizations will have information about local hobbies and events. Apps like Facebook
                and
                Meetup can also help you find events in your community and meet people who have the same
                interests.</li><br>
            <li> Adopt a pet. Having another living creature to come home to could help your life feel fuller,
                and
                increase your feelings of connection to the world in general. Research consistently suggests
                pets
                can
                have a number of mental health benefits, including decreasing loneliness. What’s more, walking a
                dog
                (or
                cat, in some cases!) can also help increase your chances of meeting new people.</li><br>

                    alt="pic" width="800">
            </div><br>
            <li>Get out of the house. Technology can have a lot of benefits. You might enjoy the convenience
                of
                having
                meals delivered to your door or movies through a Wi-Fi connection. But technology can also make
                it
                easier to miss out. Try an evening out at your local theater or take a walk to your neighborhood
                farmer’s market to get ingredients for your next meal. Make a goal of greeting and talking to a
                few
                new
                people each time you go out, even if it’s as simple as a smile and “hello.”</li><br>

            <li>Get comfortable with spending time alone. This doesn’t mean you have to be alone all the
                time.
                It’s generally considered important for people to have at least some contact with others. But if
                you
                enjoy
                the time you spend on your own, you’re more likely to feel positive about it, even when being
                alone
                may
                not be your first choice.</li> <br>
            <li> Choose fulfilling and rewarding activities. Relaxing on the sofa in front of your favorite TV
                show
                can
                feel comforting, and humorous content in particular, may have a positive impact on your mood.
                But
                make
                sure to include a range of activities in your life, including creative or physical pursuits.
                Even
                listening to music or reading a book could have more of a positive impact on loneliness.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Make time for exercise. Exercise is known to have a positive impact on mental health. While
                exercise
                may not relieve loneliness on its own, it can help improve your mood overall and increase your
                feelings

            <li> Enjoy the outdoors. Sunlight can help increase serotonin in your body, which can help improve
                your
                mood. Research suggests spending time in nature can help relieve feelings of depression,
                anxiety,
                and
                stress. Joining a group walk or team sport can also help you connect with others at the same
                time.</li><br>
            <li> Focus on developing quality relationships. Seek people who share similar attitudes,
                interests, and
                values with you.</li><br>
            <li>Stay in touch with loved ones. If you’ve just moved, try to talk to friends and family
                weekly.
                Apps
                like Skype, Snapchat, and Facebook Messenger let you send video clips or communicate through
                video.
                It
                may not feel the same as in-person contact, but it can help you remember the people you love are
                still
                there for you.</li><br>

                If feelings of loneliness linger, it may be a good idea to reach out to your healthcare provider
                or
                a
